# MASM Quadratic Solver (CPEN 3710)

For this lab, we create a multimodule program that combines the C++ language with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) to determine if the quadratic equation has two roots, a single root, or a complex root. This program utilizes MASM's floating-point unit (FPU) to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation given a, b, and c.
